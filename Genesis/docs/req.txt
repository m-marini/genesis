Requirements for 1.0.0

Define the input functions in terms of boolean
functions.

Add the unit input, use to introduce the thresholds or
offsets input values in the network

Save the simulation state in xml file 

Load the simulation state in xml file 

Add non linear neural transfer function

Add feedbeck cycle in inference

Add input/output normalization functions

Add crossbreed of living being

Add Use cases

Create new simulation

Set parameters

Create population

Run simulation

Stop simulation

Add ui

Change simulation rules:
use a fix population size, define life time, after the life time keep a defined number
 of being and substitute the worst other (less energy) with new crossbreeded being
 from the best being and repeat.

Simulation user interface (SUI):

SUI allows to load test, load simulation, save simulation, run and stop simulation.

SUI shows the current best error, worst error, the absolute best error.

SUI shows the sample results of best current net.

SUI shows the weights value of best current net.

SUI shows the result of the population

View:

Population view.
It shows a table with the result of the population

Errors view.
It shows the history of errors: current best error, current worst error, absolute
best error and cycle number, current cycle number.

Sample results view.
It shows the sample results of a net.

Check for the save

Merge e reorg function on XML with XSL.

Probabilistic function to choose the parents
The best net has more probablity to be choosen then the worst net
